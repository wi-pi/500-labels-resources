# Datasets

This folder contains all of the data that is not publicly available.
We provide the synthetic dataset and the dataset where we removed the background from the images.
This data was only used when evaluating Instagram.
For TikTok, FairFace was used for the evaluation.

## Results Folder
Within the results folder we provide all raw data points we used for figure generation.
These results are gathered using the Frida scripts within the dynamic analysis folder.
For the Instagram's evaluation we provide three different files.
Each file contains a single dataset that we gave to instagram for each evaluation.

We included the data points for TikTok and the data from the real and synthetic data.
The imagenet and fairface results for Instagram are too large to include on this repo.
We will upload them to a hosting site that supports it later.
If you want the data sooner email jwwest@wisc.edu.
