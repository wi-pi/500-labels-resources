# OS Code Changes

This folder contains all of our changes to the Lineage-19 os and the actual custom ROM.

## Source code folder
All file changes we made to the lineage os are located within the source code folder.
These are the raw c++ files that the operating system compiles when creating the ROM.
If you would like to build these files, we recommend replacing their existing equavilent with the contents provided.
A more robust tutorial will be provided at a later date. 

We also plan on making a patching script.
This script will automatically apply our changes to an existing pull of the operating system.
